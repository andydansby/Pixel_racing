A demonstration of some of the fastest Pixel routines for the ZX Spectrum without resorting to some large LUT.  A small LUT is fine.

I've scoured the internet, looked at other source codes in order to find the Fastest Pixel in the west for the ZX Spectrum.  Here are the 14 fastest ones I could find. Some are duplicates but with an added small LUT table.

I'm trying my best to avoid huge LUT, as they are not only bulky and memory hogs, but the fastest one has to be aligned in memory.  I've tried my best to find the original sources to each routine, but with so many duplicates out there, it's difficult to find out who created what.

If you are the original author, or I have mis-attributed your name or posting, let me know and I'll change it.

If you have a fast routine, I have space in my program to add others.

As a compairson, I have as the very first option included the ZX Spectrum ROM routine, which is slow and does not fill the entire screen, only 172 pixels.  However, it does not take up any precious RAM.

enjoy
